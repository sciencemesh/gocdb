# GOCDB Docker Container
Docker files to provide a containerized version of GOCDB (https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GOCDB/Documentation_Index) for the **CS3MESH4EOSC** project.

The `html` directory contains all modified HTML files of the GOCDB that differ from the original version.

Various configuration files can be found in `config`; these are mainly used to configure the web server of the GOCDB and usually don't need to be modified.

## Running the containers
Use the Helm templates provided in the `charts` directory to deploy the GOCDB in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage
GOCDB offers a comfortable web frontend to manage the topology of a mesh; it also offers various REST API endpoints to query and modify the topology data.

- The GOCDB frontend can be reached at: [/gocdb](http://localhost/gocdb)
- The public API can be reached at: [/gocdbpi/public](http://localhost/gocdbpi/public)
- The private API can be reached at: [/gocdbpi/private](http://localhost/gocdbpi/private)

## Changes made
The following changes were made to the original GOCDB code:
- Set up `lib/Doctrine/bootstrap_doctrine.php`, allowing configuration via environment variables
- Add ScienceMesh username/password authentication based on site accounts (see `lib/Authentication/`)
    - Env. variable `SITEACC_API` used to specify site accounts service URL
- Allow login via a simple form (located under `/gocdb/login/`; see `htdocs/web_portal/login/`)
- Fix bug in `lib/Gocdb_Services/Role.php` not updating the Role record ID: After calling `em->persist`, `em->flush` has to be called to set generated values properly
    - Also apply the same fix to a bunch of other files, just in case...
- The `GOCDBAuthProvider` used a non-existing class; fix by passing the required reference in the constructor
- PI: Protect all methods via an API key (env. variable `GOCDB_API_KEY`)
- Write PI: Extensions for automatically creating/updating/removing user accounts added under `htdocs/PI/write/ext/`; these work independently from the main PI

## Notes
To make setting up and working with the GOCDB easy, user authentication was removed. This renders some features unusable, like applying user roles.
